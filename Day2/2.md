## Class vs Function Components

#### Class Components

- Stateful: can manage state
- Lifecycle: Access to lifecycle methods
- Verbose: More boilerplate code.
- Not Preferred anymore

#### Functional Components

- Initially stateless
- Can use Hooks for state and effects.
- Simpler and more concise.
- More Popular.

## What is JSX?

1. Definition: JSX determines how the UI will look wherver the component is used.

2. Not HTML: Though it resembles HTML, you are actually writing JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML.

3. Conversion: JSX gets converted to regular JavaScript.

4. Babeljs.io/repl is a tool that allows you to see how JSX is transformed into javascript.

## Exporting Components

1. Enables the use of a component in other parts of the app.

2. Default Export: Allows exporting a single component as the default from a module.

3. Named Export: Allows exporting multiple items from a module.

4. Inporting: To use an exported component, you need to import it in the desired place using import syntax.


## Other important points

1. Naming: Must be capitalized; lowercase for default HTML.

2. HTML: Unlike vanilla JS where we cant directly write HTML, in React, you can embed HTML-like syntax using JSX.

3. CSS: In React, CSS can be directly imported into compoenet files, allowing for modular and component-specific styling.

## Dynamic Components

1. Dynamic Content: JSX allows the creation of dynamic and interactive UI components.

2. Javascript Expressions: Using {}. we can embed any js expression directly within JSX. This includes variables, function calls, and more.

## Reusable Components

1. `Modularity`: Components are modular, allowing for easy reuse across different parts of an application.

2. `Consistency`: Reusing components ensures UI consistency and reduces the chance of discrepancies.

3. `Maintainability`: Changes made to a reused component reflect everywhere it's used, simplifying updates and bug fixes.

4. `Efficiency`: Reduces developement time and effort by avoiding duplication of code.
