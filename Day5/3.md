## Managing State

1. State represents data that changes over the time.
2. State is local and private to the component.
3. State changes cause the component to re-render.
4. For functional components, use the useState hook.
5. React Functions that start with word use are called hooks.
6. Hooks should only be used inside components.
7. Parents components can pass state down to children via props.
8. Lifting state up: Share state between components by moving it to their closest common ancestor.
